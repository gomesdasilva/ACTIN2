ACTIN: Activity Indices Toolkit
===============================

ACTIN is a python tool that calculates user defined spectroscopic activity indices for different spectrographs.

The method used is based on the original s-index (see `Duncan et al. 1991 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJS...76..383D/abstract>`_), where the flux in the cores of the activity sensitive lines is divided by reference pseudo-continuum regions.
The flux determination, index calculation and errors are described in the Appendix A of `Gomes da Silva et al. (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...646A..77G/abstract>`_.
The errors are the photon noise, however there is an option to include extra noise, which is added in quadrature to the overall errors.

Included are some of the most used activity proxies in the optical:

- CaII H&K (S-index)
- H$\alpha$ (using 0.6 and 1.6 angstrom bandpasses)
- NaI D2
- HeI

A description of these indices is provided in `Gomes da Silva et al. (2011) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...534A..30G/abstract>`_.
Other indices can be added easily by editing the indices table (see `The indices table <file:///Users/jgsilva/Astrophysics/Packages/ACTIN2/docs/_build/html/add_index.html>`_).

Implemented spectrographs:

- HARPS
- HARPS-N
- ESPRESSO

New instruments are easy to implement (see `Adding new spectrographs <file:///Users/jgsilva/Astrophysics/Packages/ACTIN2/docs/_build/html/add_spec.html>`_).
Activity indices can also be calculated for any spectrum if the wavelength and flux are available (see `Using ACTIN with any spectra <file:///Users/jgsilva/Astrophysics/Packages/ACTIN2/docs/_build/html/calc_act_general.html>`_).

With a simple one line python code, it is possible to run ACTIN on a list of fits files and extract a list of activity indices:

.. code:: python

   from actin2 import ACTIN
   actin = ACTIN()
   
   df = actin.run(files, indices=['I_CaII', 'I_NaI'])

where ``files`` is the list of fits file paths to be read, ``Ã¬ndices`` is the list of index identification names (as in the indices table), and ``df`` is the pandas DataFrame with the output time series including the selected headers such as radial-velocity, Julian date, and activity data. See the tutorials for more information.
